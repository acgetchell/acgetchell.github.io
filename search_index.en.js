awhile, I've been interested in establishing a secure, verifiable, public\nidentity.\nThere are any number of reasons to do this, for example,\nauthenticity and non-repudiation,\nfrictionless sharing of files, and so forth. But that's the topic of\nanother article. What I want to talk about here is how I got to the promised\nland.\nFirst up is Keybase, which is a really awesome software\nstack that maps your identity to your public keys. You might want to\nread about it. Go ahead, I'll wait.\nSignup is currently by invite only, but if you know someone already on it\nyou might be able to wrangle an invite.\nWhen you do sign up, they'll ask for an email address. Of course, we all\nknow that email is notoriously insecure, subject to spamming,\nad-analytics, and any number of security maladies, but I didn't want to\nbow to that (seeming) inevitability.\nAs it turns out, this was the perfect opportunity to use another highly secure\nservice I'd been playing with: ProtonMail.\nProtonMail has encrypted identities in order to retrieve your data, is housed\nin Switzerland (so certain entities won't obtain access easily), is encrypted\nagain with your own key which ProtonMail doesn't know so that they cannot\naccess your data even if certain entities force them to hand it over, has mobile app versions, and implements all the right sorts of technologies to\npatch up the leaky sieve of general purpose electronic correspondence while\nstill remaining useful to non-Sendmail-grognards.\nNow, if I'm going to bother to have a vanity domain like adamgetchell.org,\nI may as well have an email address like adam@... So while the free version of\nProtonMail is fine for tinkering, I stepped up to a paid account in order\nto get these and other features, as we'll go over shortly. For $48 per year,\nnot too bad, and I felt good about supporting them.\nThe next step towards greater email security is to verify you own your domain.\nMy domain registrar is Joker, a fine German domain registrar also housed\nin Switzerland (seeing a theme?) that runs me about $12/year. ProtonMail\nprovides a nice wizard to step you through everything, so from that:\n\nYou go to your DNS registrar and add the requested TXT record.\nValidate it.\nNext, you'll need to add the MX record for your vanity domain, with the data\nthat ProtonMail supplies. There's a pretty screenshot I could show, but data is\nrather trivial: set up an MX record, with a value of mail.protonmail.ch and a\npriority of 10, and you're good to go. Give it some time to propagate through\nDNS-land; eat lunch, or have some coffee, or play your favorite game for a tick\nor two.\nNow you can just add the address in ProtonMail's Wizard (Settings-&gt;Domains)\n\nAlright, vanity email address, $\\checkmark$. Now it's time to secure it.\nYou don't want someone to be able to fake your brand new domain. This is where\nDNSSEC comes in. However, in my case, Joker's DNS servers don't\nsupport it. No problem -- switch to someone who does!\nThat someone is CloudFlare.\nCloudFlare is a cool service that boosts your website speed via optimizations\nand CDNs, helps protect your website against some forms of malicious attacks,\nand can even mitigate DDoS.\nIn this case, I'm interested in them because they provide fast, secure DNS, and\nbecause I can get a free account for my single website. What's not to like?\nI also highly recommend them in general. I've used them for a number of years\nprofessionally, and they've been worth the cost.\nOn Joker I can specify the CloudFlare will be my DNS server like so:\n\nA helpful wizard will pop up telling you that you're about to transfer records\nover, which you should do. (Actually, I turned on DNSSEC much later in the\nprocess than what I'm writing here. Thus, most of my DNS changes were actually\nmade on Joker's DNS servers, then migrated over to CloudFlare. That worked just\nfine.)\nOnce you've verified that CloudFlare is now handling your DNS, it's a simple\nmatter to switch on DNSSEC:\n\nNow, back to email! Just like we don't want someone to spoof our domain, we\ndon't want to someone to spoof emails. Time for DKIM, SPF, and\nDMARC.\nProtonMail provides guides for setting up anti-spoofing for custom domains,\nincluding configuring DKIM, SPF, and DMARC records.\nWhew! That was a long detour, but we finally have a secure email address to use\nfor Keybase.\n\nOnce you've installed Keybase (e.g. brew cask install keybase), you'll want to\nnote down your 'paper' key someplace safe (like, say, a Secure Note in\n1Password). And then, you'll want to start adding identities, such as\nTwitter, GitHub, Reddit, and your website.\nThis is pretty straightforward; you sign objects with your public key and\npost them someplace public on that service (e.g. a tweet, gist, post, or static\nfile).\nFor example, here's my GitHub proof:\nThe neat thing about Keybase is that you don't need a central server to verify\nsomeone's identity: you can do it yourself right from the command line:\n\nNow, if you want your website to be part of your identity, you'll want it to be\nsecure. My website happens to be generated by Pelican and hosted on\nGitHub, for which I have 2-factor authentication turned on. But by default,\nGitHub hosted sites only support SSL for *.github.io domains.\nCloudFlare does, sorta. So we come to the second reason for\nusing CloudFlare: enabling https on your static, custom domain. It's as easy\nas flicking a switch:\n\nHOWEVER this is not complete; it only encrypts communication between\nthe client browser and CloudFlare. The connection between CloudFlare and\nGitHub is unencrypted for custom domains. It is also easy to do the\nwrong way.\nIf you didn't have a custom domain, then this doesn't apply. But where's the\nfun in that?\nFinally, to prevent the client from downgrading from https to http, you can\nturn on HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS).\n\nThis comes with some sizeable caveats, so definitely read them.\nAt last, you can check your work here: https://en.internet.nl.\nAnd now, finally, you have a nice, secure, publicly verifiable identity:\n\nUpdate\nHere are two videos from CloudFlare on boosting site speed and security:\n\nIncrease the speed of your site - CloudFlare Performance Tips\nUser Privacy &amp; Data Integrity\n\n","id":"https://www.adamgetchell.org/posts/2016-08-11-public-identity/","title":"Secure, Verifiable, Public Identity"},"https://www.adamgetchell.org/posts/2025-12-27-building-delaunay-triangulations/":{"body":"Awhile ago, I started discussing the internals of a Metropolis class for MCMC sampling of ensembles\nproduced by causal dynamical triangulations, a promising approach to quantum gravity that allows the use of computers. Well, since then I've experienced\na number of things:\n\nCGAL is an amazing library with decades of scholarship behind it. However, to make use of it my implementation required over\n160 other C++ libraries, including heavyweight dependencies like Boost and Eigen. I spent more time managing these dependencies than I\ndid writing useful code to take advantage of CGAL's capabilities.\nI also found that implementing the Pachner moves necessary for CDT was more difficult than I expected, and I alternated between making progress and getting stuck on various issues ranging from various library bugs, to impedance mismatches, down to compiler-level issues.\nFinally, I discovered that my particular use case for CGAL involved millions of repeated re-triangulations that resulted in various memory leaks, segfaults, and other impossible-for-me-to-debug issues. (Ironically, just keeping my project up-to-date I filed many, many bug reports exposing issues not seen in usual test cases.)\n\nAll of this finally tipped the balance from \"use these battle-tested libraries\" to \"roll my own implementation\".\nAfter this experience, I decided that I wanted:\n\nA performant, memory and thread-safe language that allows me to do low-level things while managing complexity\nIdeally with a functional programming paradigm to make reasoning about code easier\nAnd a developer-friendly toolchain that makes things like dependency management, linting, testing, and documenting easy instead of a constant struggle\nWith a reasonable ecosystem of libraries for numerical computing, linear algebra, and data visualization\n\nI chose Rust 🦀.\n(I considered Julia, but ruled out garbage-collected languages, which also eliminates Python, despite it's popularity in scientific computing.\nTo be fair, I do use Python for tooling and data analysis, just not for performance-critical code.)\nThis project has already progressed through numerous iterations and languages.\nThe first implementation I started working with was in Lisp; from there I attempted to port it to Clojure and then F# before finding CGAL and setting on a full re-write in C++. That, in turn, led to many years of struggle.\nSo, I started afresh with the building blocks1: implement a Delaunay triangulation library for Rust, using CGAL as a\nreference implementation, with only the functionality I needed for CDT. Originally this library was called d-delaunay, but then I found the\nmaintainer of the delaunay crate and after a brief discussion he agreed to transfer ownership to me. So now I've expanded the goals of the new crate to\nalso be useful for the original users. Along the way I completed a Rust bootcamp.\nThen AI came along and turbocharged my development efficiency. (In fact, there were so many game-changing moments that I was convinced to pursue further research and studies, but that's the topic for another post. 🙂)\nI have been able to rapidly iterate on the implementation. I have a much better understanding and appreciation for the algorithms in general and CGAL's\ndesign decisions in particular. And I have mostly followed CGAL's design, with a few guiding principles:\n\nDon't Repeat Yourself (DRY) - I ❤️ 🦀 macros!\nYou Ain't Gonna Need It (YAGNI) - Only implement what is necessary, when it is necessary.\nIdiomatic Rust - I hope that using this crate will feel natural to Rustaceans.\nPerformance &amp; Memory Safety - This needs to be both fast and accurate. My CDT use case will re-triangulate millions of times per simulation. I ❤️ 🦀 error handling!\nReproducibility &amp; Accuracy - Floating point errors are the bane of computational geometry. The library needs to be tested against and handle a wide\nrange of edge cases. I ❤️ Property-Based Testing! (And Kani is a stretch goal for formal verification of critical algorithms.)\n\nSo, after a few years of intermittent work, I present to you delaunay 📦!\nIt's still a work in progress, but I am excited about the how far I've come. You can see what's been done in the CHANGELOG.md 2, as well as what I'm\nstill planning to do in the issues and documentation.\nI look forward to sharing more about it in future posts!\n1\nSaid building blocks expanded to include fast linear algebra, which I started off by using nalgebra, but then after testing wrote my own minimal\nstack-based linear algebra library optimized for small dimensions.\n\n2\nGenerating these automatically from commits led to another Python side quest, which I hope to publish on PyPI.\n\n","id":"https://www.adamgetchell.org/posts/2025-12-27-building-delaunay-triangulations/","title":"Building Delaunay Triangulations"},"https://www.adamgetchell.org/posts/a-tale-of-two-test-frameworks/":{"body":"As I've mentioned earlier, I'm writing some scientific code that needs to be accurate and fast.\n\nThat is, some entity other than me should check for inevitable errors.\n\nSo I started Test Driven Development using GoogleTest.

A reasonable answer will take us a bit far afield, and is the\nsubject of another (pending) post. For the sake of argument, let's proceed on\nthe assumption that it's something we want to compute.\nTo do this we use the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, which is a\nmember of a more general class of algorithms known as\nMarkov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, in particular random walk\nMonte Carlo methods.\n\nIs this another long digression?\n\nProbably.\nAnyways, to have good results, we need to calculate something, in this case\nperturbations of that universe via ergodic moves, performed millions of\ntimes per simulation accurately.2\nThe simulated universe in general is an n-dimensional\nDelaunay Triangulation, which is a good3 discretized n-dimensional\nmanifold, which allows us to do Regge calculus, or\n\"General Relativity without Coordinates\", conducted on said\ntriangulations.\nHere is what these ergodic moves look like in 3D. By choosing to make these\nmoves according to the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, we effectively sample\nall possible paths as the universe moves from one time step to the next.\n\nWhich is what the path integral is?\n\nExactly.\nSo, these are the moves which sample all possible (2+1) dimensional\ndiscretized universes.\n\n\n\n\nSo how do we use these moves?\n\nFirst, let's start by generating a random, foliated triangulation with $n$\nsimplices and $t$ timeslices. Here is a program to do that.\nA foliated triangulation is a Delaunay triangulation with two criteria:\n\nEach vertex has a time value\nEach simplex contains vertices that differ by at most one time value\n\nIn (2+1) dimensions, then, we are dealing with simplices that have 4 vertices\n(an n-dimensional simplex always has n+1 vertices).\nWe can thus classify the\n(2+1) dimensional simplex as a (3,1) simplex (3 vertices on the low timeslice\nand one vertex on the high timeslice), a (2,2) simplex, or a (1,3) simplex.\nLikewise, we can name the moves similarly.\nThe top move takes a (3,1) simplex and a (2,2) simplex and converts it to a\n(3,1) simplex plus two (2,2) simplices. This is called a (2,3) move, and its\nreverse is naturally a (3,2) move.\nThe middle move takes a (1,3) simplex and a (3,1) simplex and converts it to\nthree (1,3) simplices plus three (3,1) simplices. This is a (2,6) move along\nwith the reverse (6,2) move.\nThe bottom move takes two (1,3) simplices and two (3,1) simplices and makes\ndifferent (1,3) and (3,1) simplices. This is called a (4,4) move, and it is\nits own reverse.\nThe CDT action is then based on the Regge action:\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nS^{(3)} &amp;= 2\\pi k\\sqrt{\\alpha}N_1^{TL} + N_3^{(3,1)}\\left[\n-3k\\operatorname{arcsinh}\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}\\sqrt{4\\alpha+1}}\\right)\n-3k\\sqrt{\\alpha}\\operatorname{arccos}\\left(\\frac{2\\alpha+1}{4\\alpha+1}\\right)\n-\\frac{\\lambda}{12}\\sqrt{3\\alpha+1}\\right] \\\n&amp;\\quad + N_3^{(2,2)}\\left[\n2k\\operatorname{arcsinh}\\left(\\frac{2\\sqrt{4\\alpha+2}}{4\\alpha+1}\\right)\n-4k\\sqrt{\\alpha}\\operatorname{arccos}\\left(-\\frac{1}{4\\alpha+1}\\right)\n-\\frac{\\lambda}{12}\\sqrt{4\\alpha+2}\\right]\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\nThis formula is the Regge action with some trigonometric identities applied\nafter taking the length of spacelike edges to be 1 and the length of timelike\nedges to be $\\alpha$. There are a few more constants thrown in for good\nmeasure.4\nHowever complex this looks, it generates a number.\nMetropolis-Hastings then calculates the probability of making a move as:\n$$ P=a_{1}a_{2}$$\nWhere:\n$$ a_{1}=\\frac{\\text{move}[i]}{\\sum_i\\text{move}[i]} $$\nAnd:\n$$ a_{2}=e^{\\Delta S} $$\n$a_{1}$ is essentially the probability of making $\\text{move}[i]$ versus\nmaking all other moves, and $a_{2}$ is the change in the action caused by\nmaking $\\text{move}[i]$.\nThis comes from the fact that we are using Markov chains, which forget all\nhistory except the previous move,5 and the principle of detailed balance,\nwhich states that the probability of transitioning from $x\\rightarrow x\\prime$\nequals the probability of $x\\prime\\rightarrow x$.\n$a_{1}$ is easy to calculate: you just keep track of the total successful\nmoves of each type.\n$a_{2}$ is likewise simple:\n\n\nA (2,3) move will change\n$N_1^{TL}$ and $N_3^{(2,2)}$ by +1 each; a (3,2) by -1 each.\n\n\nA (2,6) move changes $N_3^{(3,1)}$ by +4 and $N_1^{TL}$ by +2; a (6,2)\nby -4 and -2 respectively.\n\n\nA (4,4) move doesn't change the action at all; $a_2 = 1$, and only $a_1$ is\nneeded.\n\n\nBy attempting a large number of moves, some of which will be accepted6 and\nsome of which will be rejected, we can approximate the distribution thus\nproducing an ensemble.\n\nNow what?\n\nNow we can collect data on the various ensembles, and obtain things like\nspectral dimension, transition amplitudes, or in my case, the\nNewtonian Limit.\nSo that's the backstory (modulo some digressions).\nTo have results before, well, the end of the universe, we should use a fast\nlanguage, e.g. C++ together with a battle-tested library capable of manipulating\nDelaunay triangulations in various dimensions, e.g. CGAL.7\nOf course, that isn't enough, we have to write good code too. Thinking about\nthe problem statement (that we've spent most of this post on) conjures up\nGoF patterns such as the Command Pattern, the Strategy Pattern, plus the\nProducer-consumer problem.\nAll which seem to have well tested, elegant solutions.\n\nBut isn't functional programming the old/new hotness?\n\nWe'll get into that next time!\n\nYou didn't actually address the title of this post.\n\nI do need to sleep sometime.\n\nFair enough.\n\n1\nA Wick rotation converts the factor of $i$ in the continuous path\nintegral to a minus sign in the discrete path integral. In the Einstein-Hilbert\naction we keep $\\Lambda$, the Cosmological constant, but ignore\n$\\mathcal{L}_{M}$,\nthe matter Lagrangian density. In the Regge action, we are essentially\nsumming areas times angles for the first term plus volumes times the\nCosmological constant in the second term.\n\n2\nOr at least, enough times for the ensembles to \"thermalize\" into\nrepresentative distributions on which we can accurately sample the posterior.\n\n4\n$N_{1}^{TL}$ is the number of timelike links connecting vertices on\ndifferent time slices. $N_3^{(3,1)}$ is the number of (3,1) and (1,3) simplices.\n$N_{3}^{(2,2)}$ is the number of (2,2) simplices. $k=\\frac{1}{8\\pi G_N}$, where\n$G_N$ is Newton's constant. $\\lambda=k*\\Lambda$, where $\\Lambda$ is the\nCosmological constant. See? All numbers.\n\n7\nI first attempted to do this from scratch in Lisp, Clojure, F#,\nand Python. I quickly came to the realization that implementing [Delaunay\nTriangulations][5] and the necessary operations was several PhDs worth\nof research in its own right (which, in fact, CGAL is). The choice of CGAL\ninfluenced the choice of language; Python almost worked, but the\nSWIG Python bindings weren't up to the task at the time. (They still lack\naccess to the new dD Triangulation package, which I will need for (3+1)D\npath integrals.)\n\n3\nGood here means that the tools of differential geometry used on manifolds\nin General Relativity have analogs in piecewise simplicial discrete\ntriangulations, i.e., triangulations are equivalent to manifolds.\n\n5\nIt would be almost hopelessly complex if we had to consider the entire\nhistory of the universe to advance a single timestep!\n\n6\nAlas, it isn't quite this simple because Metropolis-Hastings behaves\nbadly (gets stuck) if the acceptance ratio of moves is below ~25%.\nAlternatives are needed if this is the case, which, for sufficiently large\ntriangulations, indeed occurs.\n\n","id":"https://www.adamgetchell.org/posts/designing-a-metropolis-class/","title":"Designing a Metropolis Class"},"https://www.adamgetchell.org/projects/":{"body":"Some projects I'm involved with.\nPersonal\n\nCDT-plusplus — Quantize spacetime on your laptop: a C++ implementation of Causal Dynamical Triangulations (CDT).\ndelaunay — D-dimensional Delaunay triangulations in Rust, inspired by CGAL.\nla-stack — Fast, stack-allocated linear algebra for fixed dimensions in Rust.\n\nUC Davis\n\naggieintelligence (private) — A UC Davis generative-AI chatbot for students, staff, and faculty to help find campus information and resources.\n\n","id":"https://www.adamgetchell.org/projects/","title":"Projects"},"https://www.adamgetchell.org/search/":{"body":"","id":"https://www.adamgetchell.org/search/","title":"Search"}},"docInfo":{"https://www.adamgetchell.org/":{"body":0,"title":2},"https://www.adamgetchell.org/about/":{"body":43,"title":0},"https://www.adamgetchell.org/papers/":{"body":72,"title":1},"https://www.adamgetchell.org/posts/":{"body":0,"title":1},"https://www.adamgetchell.org/posts/2016-08-11-public-identity/":{"body":593,"title":4},"https://www.adamgetchell.org/posts/2025-12-27-building-delaunay-triangulations/":{"body":443,"title":3},"https://www.adamgetchell.org/posts/a-tale-of-two-test-frameworks/":{"body":224,"title":4},"https://www.adamgetchell.org/posts/can-ligo-detect-graviton/":{"body":214,"title":3},"https://www.adamgetchell.org/posts/designing-a-metropolis-class/":{"body":696,"title":3},"https://www.adamgetchell.org/projects/":{"body":50,"title":1},"https://www.adamgetchell.org/search/":{"body":0,"title":1}},"length":11},"lang":"English"}
