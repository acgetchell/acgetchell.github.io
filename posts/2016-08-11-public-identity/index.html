          <div class="content mt-2">
            <p>For awhile, I've been interested in establishing a secure, verifiable, public
identity.</p>
<p>There are <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://keybase.io/blog/2014-10-08/the-horror-of-a-secure-golden-key">any</a> <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank" href="http://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-secure-boot-key-debacle-causes-security-panic/">number</a> of reasons to do this, for example,
<a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDmj_xe7EIQ">authenticity</a> and <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank" href="http://security.stackexchange.com/questions/6730/what-is-the-difference-between-authenticity-and-non-repudiation">non-repudiation</a>,
<a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://keybase.io/docs/kbfs">frictionless sharing of files</a>, and so forth. But that's the topic of
another article. What I want to talk about here is how I got to the promised
land.</p>
<p>First up is <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://keybase.io">Keybase</a>, which is a really awesome software
stack that maps your identity to your public keys. You might want to
<a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://keybase.io/docs/kbfs">read about</a> it. Go ahead, I'll wait.</p>
<p>Signup is currently by invite only, but if you know <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://keybase.io/adamgetchell">someone</a> already on it
you might be able to wrangle an invite.</p>
<p>When you do sign up, they'll ask for an email address. Of course, we all
know that email is <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.viget.com/articles/email-is-completely-insecure-by-default">notoriously insecure</a>, <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank" href="http://www.howtogeek.com/180604/htg-explains-why-is-spam-still-a-problem/">subject to spamming</a>,
<a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank" href="http://www.wired.com/2015/03/ugly-mail/">ad-analytics</a>, and any number of security maladies, but I didn't want to
bow to that (seeming) inevitability.</p>
<p>As it turns out, this was the perfect opportunity to use another highly secure
service I'd been playing with: <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://proton.me">ProtonMail</a>.</p>
<p>ProtonMail has encrypted identities in order to retrieve your data, is housed
in Switzerland (so certain entities won't obtain access easily), is encrypted
again with your own key which ProtonMail doesn't know so that they cannot
access your data even if certain entities force them to hand it over, has mobile app versions, and implements all the right sorts of technologies to
patch up the leaky sieve of general purpose electronic correspondence while
still remaining useful to non-Sendmail-grognards.</p>
<p>Now, if I'm going to bother to have a vanity domain like <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://adamgetchell.org">adamgetchell.org</a>,
I may as well have an email address like adam@... So while the free version of
<a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://proton.me">ProtonMail</a> is fine for tinkering, I stepped up to a paid account in order
to get these and other features, as we'll go over shortly. For $48 per year,
not too bad, and I felt good about supporting them.</p>
<p>The next step towards greater email security is to verify you own your domain.</p>
<p>My domain registrar is <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://joker.com">Joker</a>, a fine German domain registrar also housed
in Switzerland (seeing a theme?) that runs me about $12/year. ProtonMail
provides a nice wizard to step you through everything, so from that:</p>
<p><img src="/img/dns-verification.png" alt="DNS Verification" /></p>
<p>You go to your DNS registrar and add the requested TXT record.
<a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190128075300/https://docs.menandmice.com/display/MM/How+to+test+DNSSEC+validation">Validate it</a>.</p>
<p>Next, you'll need to add the MX record for your vanity domain, with the data
that ProtonMail supplies. There's a pretty screenshot I could show, but data is
rather trivial: set up an MX record, with a value of <code>mail.protonmail.ch</code> and a
priority of <code>10</code>, and you're good to go. Give it some time to propagate through
DNS-land; eat lunch, or have some coffee, or play your favorite game for a tick
or two.</p>
<p>Now you can just add the address in ProtonMail's Wizard (Settings-&gt;Domains)</p>
<p><img src="/img/protonmail-vanity.png" alt="Setup address using your domain in ProtonMail" /></p>
<p>Alright, vanity email address, $\checkmark$. Now it's time to secure it.</p>
<p>You don't want someone to be able to fake your brand new domain. This is where
<a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://grokipedia.com/page/Domain_Name_System_Security_Extensions">DNSSEC</a> comes in. However, in my case, <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://joker.com">Joker</a>'s DNS servers don't
support it. No problem -- switch to someone who does!</p>
<p>That someone is <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.cloudflare.com">CloudFlare</a>.</p>
<p>CloudFlare is a cool service that boosts your website speed via optimizations
and CDNs, helps protect your website against some forms of malicious attacks,
and can even mitigate DDoS.</p>
<p>In this case, I'm interested in them because they provide fast, secure DNS, and
because I can get a free account for my single website. What's not to like?</p>
<p>I also highly recommend them in general. I've used them for a number of years
professionally, and they've been worth the cost.</p>
<p>On Joker I can specify the CloudFlare will be my DNS server like so:</p>
<p><img src="/img/cloudflare-dns.png" alt="CloudFlare DNS Settings on Joker" /></p>
<p>A helpful wizard will pop up telling you that you're about to transfer records
over, which you should do. (Actually, I turned on DNSSEC much later in the
process than what I'm writing here. Thus, most of my DNS changes were actually
made on Joker's DNS servers, then migrated over to CloudFlare. That worked just
fine.)</p>
<p>Once you've verified that CloudFlare is now handling your DNS, it's a simple
matter to switch on DNSSEC:</p>
<p><img src="/img/cloudflare-dnssec.png" alt="CloudFlare DNSSEC" /></p>
<p>Now, back to email! Just like we don't want someone to spoof our domain, we
don't want to someone to spoof emails. Time for <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6376">DKIM</a>, <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7208">SPF</a>, and
<a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DMARC">DMARC</a>.</p>
<p>ProtonMail provides guides for setting up anti-spoofing for custom domains,
including configuring DKIM, SPF, and DMARC records.</p>
<p>Whew! That was a long detour, but we finally have a secure email address to use
for <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://keybase.io/docs/kbfs">Keybase</a>.</p>
<p><img src="/img/spamminess.png" alt="Email Spamminess" /></p>
<p>Once you've installed Keybase (e.g. <code>brew cask install keybase</code>), you'll want to
note down your 'paper' key someplace safe (like, say, a Secure Note in
<a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://1password.com">1Password</a>). And then, you'll want to start adding identities, such as
Twitter, GitHub, Reddit, and your website.</p>
<p>This is pretty straightforward; you sign objects with your public key and
post them someplace public on that service (e.g. a tweet, gist, post, or static
file).</p>
<p>For example, here's my <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://gist.github.com/acgetchell/7b68d1168a45859624d0cb3369931ace">GitHub proof</a>:</p>
<p>The neat thing about Keybase is that you don't need a central server to verify
someone's identity: you can do it yourself right from the command line:</p>
<p><img src="/img/keybase-id-proof.png" alt="Keybase proof from CLI" /></p>
<p>Now, if you want your website to be part of your identity, you'll want it to be
secure. My website happens to be generated by <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank" href="http://blog.getpelican.com">Pelican</a> and hosted on
GitHub, for which I have 2-factor authentication turned on. But by default,
<a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://help.github.com/articles/securing-your-github-pages-site-with-https/">GitHub hosted sites only support SSL for <code>*.github.io</code> domains</a>.</p>
<p><a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.cloudflare.com">CloudFlare</a> does, sorta. So we come to the second reason for
using CloudFlare: enabling <code>https</code> on your static, custom domain. It's as easy
as flicking a switch:</p>
<p><img src="/img/github-ssl.png" alt="GitHub SSL" /></p>
<p><strong>HOWEVER</strong> this is not complete; it only encrypts communication between
the client browser and CloudFlare. <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://help.github.com/articles/securing-your-github-pages-site-with-https/">The connection between CloudFlare and
GitHub is unencrypted for custom domains</a>. It is also easy to do <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://thehackerblog.com/keeping-positive-obtaining-arbitrary-wildcard-ssl-certificates-from-comodo-via-dangling-markup-injection/index.html">the
wrong way</a>.</p>
<p>If you didn't have a custom domain, then this doesn't apply. But where's the
fun in that?</p>
<p>Finally, to prevent the client from downgrading from <code>https</code> to <code>http</code>, you can
turn on HTTP Strict Transport Security <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/HTTP_Strict_Transport_Security_Cheat_Sheet">(HSTS)</a>.</p>
<p><img src="/img/hsts.png" alt="HTTP Strict Transport Security on CloudFlare" /></p>
<p>This comes with some sizeable caveats, so definitely read them.</p>
<p>At last, you can check your work here: <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://en.internet.nl">https://en.internet.nl</a>.</p>
<p>And now, finally, you have a <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://keybase.io/docs/kbfs">nice, secure, publicly verifiable identity</a>:</p>
